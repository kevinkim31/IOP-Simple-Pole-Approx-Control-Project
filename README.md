# IOP-Simple-Pole-Approx-Control-Project


This project deals with a classical control experiment where the objective is to position a ball on a
beam by appropriately inclining the beam. A DC motor is used to control a lever arm, which
in turn is used to raise or lower the right side of the beam to cause the ball to move. The beam
itself consists of two parallel rods, which together with the ball form a potentiometer used to
measure the ball’s position. One of the rods has a resistive film glued onto it, while the other rod
and the ball form the wiper of the potentiometer. The left side of the beam is pivoted on a support.
The input to the ball and beam apparatus is the motor voltage; both the ball position and the motor
gear angle are measurable outputs.
